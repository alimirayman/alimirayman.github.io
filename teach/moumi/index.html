      Khulna University of Engineering & Technology (KUET), Bangladesh established in 1967 as Khulna Engineering College, starts
      its long cherished Journey in 3 June 1974 after receiving special direction from the Father of Nation Bangabandhu Shiekh
      Mujibur Rahman. Later to ensure the better academic and research capabilities and environment, it is converted to an
      autonomous institute called Bangladesh Institute of Technology (BIT), Khulna in July 1986. To meet the demands of the
      days in the academic and research arena, the institute was upgraded and renamed as Khulna University of Engineering &
      Technology (KUET) in September 2003.
